Product Need:  

There is a security problem where anyone can enter the building on Oxford Road without any sort of identification. The security company hired only takes physical records of the people entering the building. However, there is no proper authorization or authentication so anyone is allowed to go to different stairs. Additionally, the names of employees and visitors entering the building are stored in a book which inconclusively causes an uproar when it is time to search for someone who has already entered the building. A computer system should be implemented to keep a record of the different names and times that each person enters the building. It should also state whether employees have associates along with them, the time they enter, and whether employees are late or early.
